# SetnTick(Countdown Timer)

The **SetnTick** is a web-based countdown timer that allows users to input a specific time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds, and then displays the countdown on the screen. The timer includes an animated UI, where each digit of the countdown is updated in real time with a smooth transition. When the countdown reaches zero, an alert sound is played, and an alert message pops up saying "Time's up!".
